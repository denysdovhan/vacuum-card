# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/`: TypeScript source for the custom Lovelace card (entry: `src/vacuum-card.ts`).
- `dist/`: Build output (bundled card JS). This is generated by Rollup.
- `rollup.config.mjs`: Build pipeline and asset handling.
- `eslint.config.mjs`: Lint configuration.
- `package.json`: Scripts, dependencies, and release config.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm install`: Install dependencies.
- `npm run start`: Watch mode build (Rollup) for local development.
- `npm run build`: Production bundle to `dist/`.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on `src/`.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Auto-fix lint issues in `src/`.
- `npm run format`: Format with Prettier (respects `.prettier` settings in `package.json`).
- `npm test`: Runs `lint` then `build` (no separate test suite).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript, ES modules (`"type": "module"`).
- Formatting: Prettier with single quotes (`"singleQuote": true`).
- Linting: ESLint (see `eslint.config.mjs`) using `@typescript-eslint` and `eslint-plugin-import`.
- Match existing patterns in `src/` for file naming and exports; prefer descriptive, kebab-case filenames for components.

## Testing Guidelines

- No dedicated test framework is configured.
- Use `npm test` to validate linting and the production build.
- Keep changes buildable; avoid introducing new build-time warnings.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (Angular preset), e.g. `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore(deps): ...`.
- Dependency updates should use `chore(deps): ...` to align with release rules.
- PRs should include: a concise description, what changed, and how it was validated (commands run). If UI changes are visible, include a screenshot or GIF.

## Release & Automation Notes

- Releases are handled by semantic-release on `main` with assets from `dist/vacuum-card.js`.
- Ensure build output remains stable when changing dependencies or build config.
